This dataset simulates customer behavior for a fictional telecommunications company. It contains demographic information, account details, services subscribed to, and whether the customer ultimately churned (stopped using the service) or not. The data is synthetically generated but designed to reflect realistic patterns often found in telecom churn scenarios.


The purpose of the project is to predict whether a customer will churn or not. THe main model used was a Decision Tree model. In addition, the project includes feature importance analysis based on information gain.
